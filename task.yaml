# Complete the third Stage of the CGPA calculator,
# It must be able to calculate the gps (5,4,3,2,1 and A B C D E F) for all courses stored in the DB
# In stage 3 , the program should print all grade point averages for all courses in a tabular manner(hint , string manipulation)
# things to note
# if there is no course in the DB , display an error to the user when he tries to enter stage 3
# Hint : You need a Gpa calculator Class, a GradePoint Enum (or not)


#TO CALCULATE CGPA => GpaCalculator
# I need to assign grade (A,B,C,D,E, & F) to each score
# Each grade has its value (A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, E=1 F=0) => Enum is suitable
# Multiply each grade value by the number of unit(s) and sum to get total credit obtained (TCO)
# Multiply each course unit by the highest grade value to get total obtainable credit (TOC)
# Divide TCO by TOC (TCO/TOC)*5 to get grade point average.




#Note
# since the app will be expanded, it will be good to be able to calculate gpa per semester.
# A get course list by semester Id might be needed.
